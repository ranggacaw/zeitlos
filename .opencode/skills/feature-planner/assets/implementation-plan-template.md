# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

> **Multi-increment features only.** This file is written just for the current increment; it is regenerated each increment. Run-order state lives in `roadmap.md` (the Status column), which is what `feature-planner <slug> status|continue` reads.
>
> Single-proposal features do not produce this file — their plan feeds directly into a Prompter proposal or into implementation, and they are resumed through Prompter's own tooling.

## Increment Roadmap
> Save this section + "Next Increment to Run" to a durable file `prompter/features/{feature}/roadmap.md` — the run-order tracker. Everything below "Codebase Analysis" is the detailed plan for the **current increment only** and lives in the transient `prompter/features/{feature}/implementation-plan.md`.
> The **Status** column is a cache: `/apply` and `/archive` don't write to it. Resume Mode (`feature-planner <slug> status|continue`) derives real status from Prompter's `changes/<change-id>/` (scaffolded/in progress) and `changes/archive/*<change-id>*/` (archived) dirs each run and rewrites this column to match.
> Each increment below becomes **one** Prompter proposal (`change-id`), run in dependency order. The Database/Backend/Frontend/Tests **phases** under "Implementation Tasks" live *inside* one increment — they are not separate proposals.

| Increment | Scope | Proposed `change-id` | Depends on | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [Foundational slice] | `add-...` | — | not created / scaffolded / in progress / archived |
| 2 | [Slice] | `add-...` | Increment 1 | not created |
| 3 | [Slice] | `add-...` | Increment 2 | not created |

> The "Implementation Tasks" section below details **Increment 1 only**. Plan each later increment when its dependencies are merged.

### UI Design References (optional — written by `ui-ux-pro`, lives in `roadmap.md`)
> Do not fill this at planning time. When the feature's screens are designed with the `ui-ux-pro` skill, it appends this section to the durable `prompter/features/{feature}/roadmap.md`, mapping each approved preview to its increment. `feature-planner {feature} continue` then copies the matching rows into each scaffolded proposal as a `## Design Reference` section plus per-page `Implement UI per approved preview` tasks. Preserve this section verbatim when updating the roadmap's Status column.

**Design:** `<feature>` — hub: `.preview/<feature>/index.html`

| Increment | Page | Approved preview | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | [Page] | `.preview/<feature>/<page>/hifi.html` | [key sections/decisions, one line] |

### Next Increment to Run
> Multi-increment features only. This plan details and builds **Increment 1**; trigger each later increment yourself once its dependencies have merged — grounding it on the real, merged codebase instead of a stale guess.

**Next up:** [`add-...` — Increment N (Scope)]  ← the first roadmap row with status `not created` whose dependencies are met.

Advance the roadmap by running Resume Mode (it scaffolds the next increment's proposal and bumps its Status):

```
feature-planner {feature} continue
```

Check progress anytime with `feature-planner {feature} status`.

> `continue` scaffolds the proposal and hands off — implement it with `/apply <change-id>`, then `/archive` when done. It does not re-plan; re-run the full interview only if you want fresh codebase analysis for an increment's detailed plan.

After that increment is implemented and archived, run `continue` again for the next row.

## Codebase Analysis

### Tech Stack Detected
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | [e.g., Next.js, React] |
| Backend | [e.g., Laravel, Express] |
| Database | [e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL] |
| Other | [e.g., Redis, Docker] |

### Affected Files & Modules
| File / Module | Change Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| [path/to/file] | New / Modify / Delete | [What changes] |

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- [Pattern 1 observed in codebase -- e.g., "Controllers use single-action pattern"]
- [Pattern 2 -- e.g., "All API responses use ApiResource wrapper"]
- [Pattern 3 -- e.g., "Tests use factories with specific naming convention"]
